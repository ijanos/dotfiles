This is a collection of my configuration files and some small utility scripts.

I hardlink the files to their desired location and use the unused.sh script to
quickly check which one I forgot to link.

I'm not sure if config files are protected by copyright but I'm placing
everything inside this repository in the public domain nonetheless.
See COPYING file for legal info.
