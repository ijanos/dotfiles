This is a collection of my configuration files and some small utility scripts.

I symlink the files to their desired location with a small python tool
called tuck.

I'm not sure if config files are protected by copyright but I'm placing
everything inside this repository in the public domain nonetheless.
See COPYING file for legal info.
